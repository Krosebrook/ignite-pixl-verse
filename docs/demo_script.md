## Post-Demo Q&A Prep

### Common Questions

**Q: What AI models do you use?**
> "We use the best-in-class models for each content type: GPT-5 and Gemini for text, DALL-E 3 for images, Runway for video, and MusicGen for audio. We're model-agnostic—we route to whatever delivers the best quality."

**Q: How do you ensure brand consistency?**
> "Every asset passes through our brand linter before approval. We extract colors, fonts, and style from generated content and compare against your uploaded brand kit. Violations trigger automatic fixes or human review."

**Q: Can I connect my existing tools?**
> "Yes! FlashFusion integrates with Shopify, WordPress, Zapier, and all major social platforms. We're adding more integrations every month via our Marketplace."

**Q: What about data privacy?**
> "Your content and prompts are never shared with AI model providers for training. We use zero-retention APIs, and all data is encrypted at rest and in transit. See our security docs for details."

**Q: How much does it cost?**
> "Solo creators start at $29/month. Teams are $99/month with unlimited seats. Enterprise plans include custom models, white-labeling, and dedicated support."
